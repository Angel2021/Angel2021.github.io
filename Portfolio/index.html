        <p id="p2"> Hi my name is angel. I love to learn in class. My goals for the future is to study Sports medicine and strive in the medical field. The first tine that I started to think about working I the medical field was when I had gotten injured in my baseball game so I had to go to the doctors and then my doctor was switched and the new doctor studied sports medicine and he was really helpful and understanding of how I am feeling as an athlete. This had open my eyes since I love to help people and I would love to help people continue to do what they love.</p>
